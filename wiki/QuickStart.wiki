#summary Instructions to get you going on a Unix-like system (sorry Windows)

These instructions are heavily biased towards Unix-like systems, since I'm writing them on a Mac. I have heard reports that the code does work on Windows using [http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/ ActiveState's distribution] and the same general idea of the commands listed below, although the exact text you type will probably be slightly different. You may need to omit the "`./`" before the `stasis` commands and use backslashes instead of forward slashes, I'm not exactly sure since I have not done it personally. That being said here are the instructions for Unix-like systems:

  * First you need to download the latest version of the code. There is no real release cycle at this time so you are stuck using the subversion trunk at `http://stasiscl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`. If you don't know how then your best shot is to open up a terminal and do the following (on a Mac this may require you to have the developer tools installed, which should have shipped with your computer or with the OS):

{{{
svn checkout http://stasiscl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ stasiscl
cd stasiscl
}}}

  * Create a folder on your machine that you would like to store your guild's web stats in. For purposes of the quick start I will use `/home/jqpublic/sws`. Once this is done you must copy the folder `extras` from the subversion trunk into the folder you just made. This should contain a `.js` and a `.css` file which are necessary for proper display.

  * If you want an index, you must set up a `wws-history` folder inside the one you made (`/home/jqpublic/sws/wws-history` in this example), and this must contain the normal contents of a `wws-history` folder from the standalone version of WWS (the one it makes when you click "Generate Report" and have "Update History" checked). These files are not included because I do not hold the copyright. If you do not want an index you may skip this step. In case you're wondering, the reason this is necessary is because this program does not create its own index, but is capable of making a data.xml file in the same format that the standalone version of WWS does.

  * At this point setup is complete. For each log file you wish to run, you need to call "stasis add" with the appropriate options and send it the file over standard input. On a Unix-like system you would do this in a terminal:

{{{
# Pre-2.4 log (a.k.a. v1) -- note the name of the logger is needed:
./stasis add -dir /home/jqpublic/sws -ver 1 -log Gian < /path/to/log/file

# 2.4 log (a.k.a v2) -- name of logger is not needed:
./stasis add -dir /home/jqpublic/sws -ver 2 < /path/to/log/file

# Normally boss attempts are discarded and only kills are recorded. If you wish to preserve all attempts, add "-attempt", for example:
./stasis add -dir /home/jqpublic/sws -ver 2 -attempt < /path/to/log/file
}}}

  * If you chose to create an index, when you are done adding logs you should run the following command, which will generate a data.xml inside the wws-history folder you made earlier:

{{{
./stasis history -dir /home/jqpublic/sws
}}}

  * You can now upload the contents of your folder (`/home/jqpublic/sws`) to a web server or open the various `index.html` on your local machine.

  * If at some point you wish to re-run the log file (new version of the program maybe) then you need only to run the same `stasis add` command again. It will remove the old directories and write out new ones. At some point there will probably be a way to do this automatically but for now it must be done manually.
