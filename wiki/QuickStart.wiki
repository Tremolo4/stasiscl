==Quick Start==

These instructions are heavily biased towards Unix-like systems, since I'm writing them on a Mac. That being said:

  * First you need to download the latest version of the code. There is no real release cycle at this time so you are stuck using the subversion trunk at `http://stasiscl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`. If you don't know how then your best shot is to open up a terminal and do the following (on a Mac this may require you to have the developer tools installed, which should have shipped with your computer or with the OS):

{{{
svn checkout http://stasiscl.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ stasiscl
}}}

  * Create a folder on your machine that you would like to store your guild's web stats in. For purposes of the quick start I will use `/home/jqpublic/sws`. Once this is done you must copy the folder `extras` from the subversion trunk into the folder you just made. This should contain a `.js` and a `.css` file which are necessary for proper display.

  * If you want an index, you must set up a `wws-history` folder inside the one you made, and this must contain the normal contents of a `wws-history` folder from the standalone version of WWS (the one it makes when you click "Generate Report" and have "Update History" checked). These files are not included because I do not hold the copyright. If you do not want an index you may skip this step. In case you're wondering, the reason this is necessary is because this program does not create its own index, but is capable of making a data.xml file in the same format that the standalone version of WWS does.

  * At this point setup is complete. For each log file you wish to run, you need to call "stasis add" with the appropriate options and send it the file over standard input. On a Unix-like system you would do this in a terminal:

{{{
dd
}}}
