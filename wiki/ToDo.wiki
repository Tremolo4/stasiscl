#summary Scratch page for to-do items.

Add version:2 logic for ClassGuess.pm -- should warn if players could not be identified, or perhaps be more aggressive identifying players, and should block mobs from being identified (using the relationship field)

Ability to include trash reports: -trash makes a parse called "Trash mobs" that includes all log entries not covered by a %split. Make sure this doesn't include attempts by accident if the user did not put -attempt.
